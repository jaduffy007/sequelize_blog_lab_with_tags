Sequelize Tags Lab
==================

Today's lab is an extension of yesterday's.

The first and main goal is to make sure you understand yesterday's lab.
You can refer to the solutions we posted in the
[solution branch](https://github.com/wdi-sf-fall/sequelize_blog_lab/tree/solution)
of the `sequelize_blog_lab`.

The stretch goal / bonus is to extend yesterday's lab to allow your
posts to have tags. You can refer to the in-class example of a
many-to-many relationship we posted today.

Yesterday you created a blog that had `Author`s and `Post`s. You
associated those models with a 1-to-many relationship. To do the
second half of today's lab, you should extend your blog to allow tags
on posts.  You'll need to create a `Tag` model that has a many-to-many
relationship with `Post`s.
